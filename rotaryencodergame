Sorry!
My idea is to use a rotary encider to remix Sorry!. We would use a rotary encoder to replace the cards which tell you where to move. The encoder would be coded to give you a randomized position on the board. It could also change the bginning stages of the game because you currently need to pick up a card that has a 7 on it.
